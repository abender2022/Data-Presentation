## About us

SafeGlow Solutions is a tech-forward company dedicated to enhancing home safety and energy efficiency. Leveraging advanced sensor technology and innovative software, SafeGlow Solutions specializes in the development of smart environmental monitoring systems that are capable of detecting the presence of a lit candle within a space. Our flagship product, the "CandleSense Monitor," utilizes artificial intelligence to accurately determine whether a candle is burning.

This product is designed to serve households, restaurants, spas, and any other settings where candles are frequently used, providing peace of mind through real-time alerts and automatic safety responses. SafeGlowâ€™s proprietary system can be linked to smartphones and smart home systems, allowing users to receive instant notifications if a candle is left unattended or if it detects anomalies indicating a potential fire hazard. In the event of such detections, CandleSense Monitor can trigger predefined safety protocols, such as alerting the local fire department or activating a home's fire suppression systems.

With a commitment to innovation and customer safety, SafeGlow Solutions aims to reduce fire-related incidents and provide a smarter, safer way to enjoy the ambiance of candlelight. Our blend of sophisticated technology with user-friendly interfaces positions us at the forefront of preventive fire safety in residential and commercial environments.

## The Problem

- "Annually, an estimated 23,600 fires in residences are caused by candles and result in 1,525 civilian injuries, 165 fatalities, and $390 million in direct property loss." (Topical Fire Research Series Vol. 6, No. 1: Candle Fires in Residential Structures)

- Though candles cause only 3% of all house fires, that number should be down to zero.
